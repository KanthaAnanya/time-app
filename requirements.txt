 start-to-finish guide to turn your time-app (Clock + Stopwatch + Timer) into an Android APK with Capacitor & Android Studio. Follow it in order.

0) Prerequisites (one-time)


Install Node.js (LTS) → nodejs.org (verify: node -v, npm -v)


Install Android Studio (let it install SDK & tools)


Install JDK 17 (keep your Java 25; Android Studio will use 17)


Enable USB debugging on phone (Developer options → USB debugging)



Tip: Work outside OneDrive to avoid permission issues. Use C:\Projects\.


1) Create the project
# open Command Prompt (cmd), NOT PowerShell
mkdir C:\Projects\time-app
mkdir C:\Projects\time-app\www
notepad C:\Projects\time-app\www\index.html

Paste your single-file time app HTML (the one we built) into index.html, save.

2) Initialize Capacitor
cd C:\Projects\time-app
npm init -y
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npx cap init "Time App" "com.ananya.timeapp" --web-dir=www
npm install @capacitor/android
npx cap add android
npx cap copy


3) Open in Android Studio
If npx cap open android works, use it:
npx cap open android

If Windows blocks it, open Android Studio manually → Open → select folder:
C:\Projects\time-app\android


4) Point Android Studio to JDK 17 (important)


File → Project Structure → SDK Location → JDK Location → set to
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17...


OR File → Settings → Build, Execution, Deployment → Build Tools → Gradle → Gradle JDK = JDK 17


If Gradle complains about write permission, set Gradle User Home to:
C:\Users\PC\.gradle (create the folder if missing), then Sync Project with Gradle Files.



5) Build the APK
In Android Studio:
Build → Generate App Bundles or APKs → Build APK(s)

Find the APK at:
C:\Projects\time-app\android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk


6) Install on your phone
Via USB (preferred)


Connect phone → choose File Transfer (MTP)


Copy app-debug.apk to phone’s Download folder


On phone → Files app → tap APK → Install


If blocked: Settings → Security → Install unknown apps → allow for your Files app




Or send to yourself via WhatsApp/Drive and install from there.

7) Make changes & rebuild (the quick loop)
Whenever you change www/index.html:
cd C:\Projects\time-app
npx cap copy
# (reopen Android Studio if closed) then Build → Build APK(s)


(Optional) Set your app icon


Prepare a square PNG icon (e.g., app-icon.png)


Use a generator (easyappicon.com / appicon.co) → download Android mipmap set


Replace icons in:


C:\Projects\time-app\android\app\src\main\res\mipmap-*\ic_launcher.png

Rebuild APK.

Quick Troubleshooting (fast fixes)


EPERM / cannot open Android Studio from CLI


Work outside OneDrive (C:\Projects\...) and open Studio manually → open android folder.




Gradle cannot download / lock file in ProgramData


Settings → Gradle → Gradle User Home = C:\Users\PC\.gradle → Apply → Sync.




Can’t find “Build APK(s)”


You opened the wrong folder. Open C:\Projects\time-app\android (the module with app/, gradle/, build.gradle).




Device not detected


Enable USB debugging, accept Allow USB debugging prompt, use a data cable, install OEM drivers if needed.




Outputs folder missing / shows npmkeep


Build didn’t run. Ensure Build Variant for app module is debug (View → Tool Windows → Build Variants). Then build APK(s) again.




Antivirus warnings (PowerShell/Installer)


False positives are common. Use Windows Defender; temporarily pause third-party AV during build.





That’s it! Follow these steps and you’ll go from HTML → APK smoothly every time.
If you hit a specific error, paste the exact message and I’ll pinpoint the one-line fix.


What is Capacitor?

Capacitor is a tool that allows you to turn websites (HTML/CSS/JS apps) into mobile apps for Android and iOS — without rewriting your code.

If you can build a webpage, you can build a mobile app.
Capacitor just wraps your web app inside a native app shell.

Think of it like:

Your Web App  →  Capacitor Wrapper  →  Android APK

💡 Why do we use Capacitor?
Feature	Reason
Turns web apps into phone apps	So your HTML/JS app becomes an APK
Allows Camera, Storage, Sensors	Lets web apps access phone hardware
Works with Android Studio	So you can generate APK / publish to Play Store
🧠 Basic Project Structure (after initializing Capacitor)
your-app/
 ├─ www/                ← Your web files (index.html, CSS, JS)
 ├─ capacitor.config.json ← Capacitor settings
 ├─ android/            ← Full Android app project
 └─ node_modules/       ← Installed capacitor packages

🛠 Common Capacitor Commands (Explained Clearly)
Command	What it Does	When to Use
npm init -y	Creates project config	Only once at start
npx cap init "App Name" "com.example.app"	Tells capacitor your app’s name + ID	Only once when setting up
npx cap add android	Creates the android folder	First time adding Android support
npx cap open android	Opens Android Studio	To build APK & edit native code
npx cap copy	Copies latest web code → android app	Run every time after you edit HTML/CSS/JS
npx cap sync	Copy + update plugins + refresh Android project	If adding plugins or new capabilities
npx cap doctor	Shows problems / missing settings	When debugging issues
🎭 The Two Commands You Will Use the Most
Command	Meaning	When to Run
npx cap copy	Update the Android project with your new web files	Every time you change HTML/JS/CSS
npx cap open android	Open Android Studio to rebuild the app	Whenever you want to rebuild the APK

So your daily workflow is:

Edit HTML/CSS/JS
↓
npx cap copy
↓
npx cap open android
↓
Build → Build APK(s)

🧩 Example — Creating a new app (like your Time App)
mkdir time-app
cd time-app
npm init -y
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
npx cap init "Time App" "com.ananya.timeapp" --web-dir=www
mkdir www
# (Place your index.html in www folder)
npm install @capacitor/android
npx cap add android
npx cap open android

🎉 Summary (Very Important)

Capacitor does not convert code — it wraps your web app in a native app.

Your real app UI is inside the www/ folder.

The android/ folder is the native app project opened by Android Studio.

Anytime your web code changes → run:

npx cap copy
